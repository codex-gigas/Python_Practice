It's a loop, which breaks only, if a valid integer has been given. 
The example script works like this:
The while loop is entered. The code within the try clause will be executed statement 
by statement. If no exception occurs during the execution, the execution will reach the
break statement and the while loop will be left. If an exception occurs, i.e. in the casting 
of n, the rest of the try block will be skipped and the except clause will be executed. 
The raised error, in our case a ValueError, has to match one of the names after except. 
In our example only one, i.e. "ValueError:". After having printed the text of the print 
statement,the execution does another loop. It starts with a new raw_input().
